## This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 17.0.0.

Step 1 - Identify the version of node.js that Angular requires
Angular requires an active LTS or maintenance LTS version of Node. Let's confirm your version of node.js. For information about specific version requirements, see the engines property in the package.json file.

From a Terminal window:

Run the following command: node --version
Confirm that the version number displayed meets the requirements.

## Step 2 - Install the correct version of node.js for Angular
If you do not have a version of node.js installed, please follow the directions for installation on nodejs.org

## Step 3 - Install the latest version of Angular
With node.js and npm installed, the next step is to install the Angular CLI which provides tooling for effective Angular development.

From a Terminal window run the following command: npm install -g @angular/cli.

## Step 4 - Install integrated development environment (IDE)
You are free to use any tool you prefer to build apps with Angular. We recommend the following:

## Visual Studio Code
As an optional, but recommended step you can further improve your developer experience by installing the Angular Language Service

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
